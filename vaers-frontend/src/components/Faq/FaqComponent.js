        <b style={{color: theme.color.veryDarkGrayishBlue}}>The body responds to vaccination by making more than one type of antibodies to virus parts including spike protein.

        <b style={{color: theme.color.brightBlue}}>17. Should you avoid alcohol after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine?</b><br/>
